# Covid-19-Insight with TSql
Creating insight to understand the spread  and impact of Covid-19 across the globe.
The Covid-19 data was collected from 'Our World in Data' website.

I used SQL (MS SQL) to explored the data using Data Query Languages like SELECT to query the data for different useful information. 
Also, Data Definition Langauage like CREATE and DROP was used in defining tables action.
Statements such as WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, FROM, AS, OVER, PARTITION BY, and AGGREGATE queries were used for this project.
